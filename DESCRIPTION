Description: The richness package implements a series of species abundance
    distribution, species richness, and diversity estimators. Distributions
    include the broken stick, discrete Weibull, exponential-to-e, geometric
    series, log series, Poisson log normal, scaled odds, zero-sum multinomial,
    and Zipf. Richness and diversity estimation methods include Chao 1, Chao 2,
    the corrected first-order jackknife, Fisher's alpha, inverted sampling curve
    extrapolation, rarefaction, Shannon's H, shareholder quorum subsampling
    (= coverage-based rarefaction), and Simpson's D. There are also stand-alone
    interpolators of singleton and doubleton counts.
