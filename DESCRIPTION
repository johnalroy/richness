Description: The richness package implements a series of species abundance
    distribution, species richness, and diversity estimators. Distributions
    include the broken stick, discrete Weibull, exponential-to-e, geometric
    series, half-power, log series, odds-2, Poisson log normal, scaled odds,
    zero-sum multinomial, and Zipf. Richness and diversity estimation methods
    include before-and-after transect analysis, Chao 1, Chao 2, the corrected
    first-order jackknife, Fisher's alpha, inverted sampling curve
    extrapolation, rarefaction, Shannon's H, shareholder quorum subsampling
    (= coverage-based rarefaction), and Simpson's D. There are also stand-alone
    interpolators of singleton and doubleton counts.
