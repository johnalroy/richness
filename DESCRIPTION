Description: The richness package implements a series of species abundance
    distribution, species richness, and diversity estimators. Distributions
    include the broken stick, compound exponential-geometric series, discrete
    Weibull, exponential-to-e, geometric series, half-power, inverse power, log
    series, odds-2, Poisson log normal, scaled odds, zero-sum multinomial, and
    Zipf. Richness and diversity estimation methods include before-and-after
    transect analysis, Chao 1, Chao 2, the corrected first-order jackknife,
    Fisher's alpha, the geometric series index, inverted sampling curve
    extrapolation, the outer product ratio index, rarefaction, Shannon's H,
    shareholder quorum subsampling (= coverage-based rarefaction), and Simpson's
    D. There are also random generation functions and stand-alone interpolators
    of singleton and doubleton counts.
